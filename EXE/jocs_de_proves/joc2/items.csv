Young Shinnosuke or Shin-chan for short is a very creative young boy that lives with his eccentric parents Misae and Hiroshi as well as his Prima Donna younger sister Himawari and has loads of unique friends to boot. Everyday life for little Shin-chan is full of funny (and shocking) moments most of which stem from his unnatural and sometimes profane use of language as well as his constant acts of inappropriate behavior. Shin-chan's famous elephant gag is one of the most defining moments in Crayon Shin-chan  simply because it is the epitome of crude comedy one of the core themes of the series.

6347,Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu,Fumizuki Academy isn't a typical Japanese high school. This unique institution has implemented a new and innovative system to sort its students. At the end of their freshman year students take a test that divides up the student body. The highest scorers are placed into A class all the way down until F class for the lowest of the low. Unfortunately for Akihisa Yoshii his supposedly great intellect wasn't quite enough for such a test and he's now stuck at the bottom of F class. Naturally F class has the worst facilities: not only rotten tatami mats and broken tables but also outdated equipment and worn out furniture. On the bright side his friend Yuuji Sakamoto is in the same class and to everyone's surprise the genius girl Mizuki Himeji has also ended up in the same class due to an unforeseen fever on the day of the test. Unsatisfied with their perquisites F class rallies behind Yuuji determined to take on the higher-tiered classes in order to seize their perks by using the school's Examinations Summon Battle system. The participants can summon fantasy characters—whose power levels are equal to their student's test scores—in an all-out battle. Will F class be able to rise to the top or will they live up to everyone's expectations and fail?,Comedy;Romance;School;Super Power,2010-01-07,13,454457,167,1149,7.7,https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/3/50389.jpg,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6347/Baka_to_Test_to_Shoukanjuu

A seemingly young woman named Yurine and her servant the Karas (from the Japanese word for Crow) have long maintained order and balance between the overlapped worlds ultimately keeping the demons from interrupting the lives of humans. However humans have come to forget and jest at the existence of demons and no longer understand the privilege it is to live without fear. Disgusted by this arrogance an old Karas turns his back on the laws he had once upheld and in his human form named Eko he creates an army of Mikura or mechanized demons to ready an attack on the human race. A young man named Otoha inherits the powers of the Karas and takes his place at the side of Yurine who claims that his soul called out for her while he lived the life of a human. They live in the world of the demons. It is now up to Otoha to prove himself as a Karas and restore the balance that Eko threatens to upset. Meanwhile a superstitious police officer named Sagisaka and his rational new recruit Kure follow the trail of the murders dealt by Eko's Mikura as well as the trail of a rogue Mikura named Nue. The prophecy unfolds from here into a grave revelation for all in the city.
